### **Overview**  
This project is designed for **students and job seekers** who need to **instantly optimize their resumes** based on a specific **job description** to **pass ATS screenings** and improve recruiter evaluations.  

It uses **AI-driven analysis and optimization** to enhance resumes by:  
- **Matching keywords** from job descriptions.  
- **Improving readability and structure.**  
- **Providing ATS-friendly suggestions** using **machine learning and deep learning models**.  

By leveraging **LLaMA 3 fine-tuned with LoRA**, the system generates **context-aware edits** that ensure resumes align with job requirements, increasing the chances of getting noticed by recruiters. 🚀

## **Approaches**  
### **1️⃣ Naïve Approach**  
- Uses **keyword-based matching** to compare resumes with job descriptions keywords.  
- Calculates **overlap percentage** between resume text and job-related keywords.  
- Displays **top 3 job matches** with their match percentage.  

### **2️⃣ Machine Learning (ML) Approach**  
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaned job descriptions and resumes using lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, and lemmatization.
- **Feature Engineering**: Computed four similarity metrics:
  - **TF-IDF Cosine Similarity**: Lexical overlap
  - **Jaccard Similarity**: Unique word overlap
  - **BERT Cosine Similarity**: Semantic similarity via embeddings
  - **N-Gram Overlap**: Phrase-level similarity (1–3 grams)
- **Match Scoring**: Applied a **Gaussian Mixture Model** to combine features into a composite match score (0–1 scale).
- **Modeling**: Trained multiple regression models to predict match quality from similarity features.
- **Analysis**: Used histograms and correlation heatmaps to interpret feature behavior.

### **3️⃣ Deep Learning Approach**  

We fine-tuned **LLaMA 3 (3B Instruct)** using **LoRA** on a custom dataset and uploaded it to Hugging Face as **["aaditey932/llama-resume-optimizer"](https://huggingface.co/aaditey932)**.  

**Dataset Creation:**  
- Machine learning **resumes** were sourced from **[Hire a Perfect Machine Learning Engineer](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sauravsolanki/hire-a-perfect-machine-learning-engineer)**.  
- AI-related **job descriptions** were sourced from **[Indeed Jobs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vaghefi/indeed-jobs)**.  
- These were processed through **GPT-4o** to generate structured **resume improvement suggestions** in **JSON format**, like:  

```json
{
  "edit1": {
    "to_be_edited": "Led a team of software engineers to develop a recommendation engine for e-commerce.",
    "edited": "Managed a cross-functional team of 5 engineers to build a recommendation engine, increasing conversion rates by 20%.",
    "suggestions": "Consider adding a metric for user engagement improvement."
  }
}
```

**Workflow:**  
1. The **combined dataset (resume, job description, and AI-generated edits)** was used to fine-tune **LLaMA 3** via **LoRA**.  
2. The trained model suggests **ATS-friendly improvements** for **new resumes**.  
3. The system **automatically applies edits** by replacing `"to_be_edited"` with `"edited"` in the document.  

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
- ✅ **Keyword Inclusion Score** – Measures job-related keyword alignment.  
- ✅ **Semantic Similarity Score** – Assesses content improvement.  

This enables **context-aware** and **ATS-optimized** resume edits tailored to specific job descriptions. 🚀

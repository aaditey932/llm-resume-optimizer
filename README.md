# **Resume Optimization**  
### **Overview**  
This project implements an **AI-powered resume analysis and optimization tool** that helps job seekers improve their resumes for **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)** and recruiter evaluations. It provides **keyword matching, readability enhancements, and recommendations** to increase hiring success rates.

## **Approaches**  
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Na√Øve Approach**  
- Uses **keyword-based matching** to compare resumes with job descriptions keywords.  
- Calculates **overlap percentage** between resume text and job-related keywords.  
- Displays **top 3 job matches** with their match percentage.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning (ML) Approach**  
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaned job descriptions and resumes using lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, and lemmatization.
- **Feature Engineering**: Computed four similarity metrics:
  - **TF-IDF Cosine Similarity**: Lexical overlap
  - **Jaccard Similarity**: Unique word overlap
  - **BERT Cosine Similarity**: Semantic similarity via embeddings
  - **N-Gram Overlap**: Phrase-level similarity (1‚Äì3 grams)
- **Match Scoring**: Applied a **Gaussian Mixture Model** to combine features into a composite match score (0‚Äì1 scale).
- **Modeling**: Trained multiple regression models to predict match quality from similarity features.
- **Analysis**: Used histograms and correlation heatmaps to interpret feature behavior.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Deep Learning Approach**  
This approach fine-tunes the **LLaMA 3 (3B Instruct)** model using **LoRA** on the combined dataset of resumes and job descriptions. This provides **ATS-friendly resume edits** in structured JSON format‚Äîsuggesting improvements at the word, phrase, and sentence level.

## **Data Source**  
This project uses publicly available datasets to enhance resume optimization:

1. Hire a Perfect Machine Learning Engineer (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sauravsolanki/hire-a-perfect-machine-learning-engineer) ‚Äì Helps recruiters score resumes based on job descriptions using machine learning while guiding job seekers in resume optimization.

2. Indeed Jobs Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vaghefi/indeed-jobs) ‚Äì Provides job postings scraped from Indeed, including job descriptions, salaries, locations, and company details to help job seekers understand industry requirements and expectations.
